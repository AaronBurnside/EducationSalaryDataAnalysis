# Overview
In this project there were three four data sets I analylized and compared.
First was from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/college-tuition-diversity-and-pay/?select=salary_potential.csv)  this data set showed the average staring salaries based on the college individuals graduated from
Second was from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wsj/college-salaries) this data set gave me information on average salaries based on the graduates major
The Third Data set was from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/college-majors) which i used to see the Average starting set based on Field of Study
The Fourth data set was from (https://www.uscareerinstitute.edu/blog/how-much-more-high-school-graduates-earn-than-non-graduates) which i used to give myself a base line to compare the college graduates to 

The purpose of this Software was to analyze relevent data to see how education effected income, include points such as university, field and major

# Data Analysis Results

Q1: how does the Univerity one graduates from effect the Salary
A1: the University has a large effect on entry salary as the standard deviation is 8365.50$ and a range of 58,700$. the Graphing even showed that the states that have high-end prestigious universities like California and New York having much higher average entry salaries of over 65,000$ for college graduates while most other state college graduates only average around 45-49 thousand

Q2: how big of an impact does the field of study have on entry Salaries 
A2: an even large impact than University does as the standard deviation is 9503.85$ and the Range is 34758.62$, an interesting point of note in this data set was that analysis showed that the average entry job in a engineering field had a higher starting salary than one in a Health Field

Q3: how big of an impact does the Major of your degree have on entry Salaries 
A3: About the Same as that of Field/Department, with the standard deviation being only slightly at 9360.86$ and the Range being slightly greater at 40300.00$ 

Q4: how does each level of Education Impact Salary
A4: the Data shows that a High School Diploma comes with a 1.235 times higher salary than dropping out of high school, and a college diploma starts at around a 1.55 times higher salary than the High School Diploma.

# Future Work
* woould like to a add machine learning algorithm to predict salaries
* complete the comparison chart for the Education Levels in Each state
